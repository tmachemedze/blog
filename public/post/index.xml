      <description>IntroductionHarmonised elections recently held in Zimbabwe (30/07/2018) were disputed by the leading opposition party, MDC-Alliance. Therefore, they petitioned the Constitional Court to overturn President Emmerson Mnangagwaâ€™s victory as announced by the electoral board, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). The Constitutional court hearing was on 22 Agust 2018 and was trending by the twitter hashtags; #ConCourtdecides, #ConCourtZW, #ElectionPetitionZW, #ZimConCourt, #zimconcourtchallenge. The court ruling was also set for the 24th of August 2018.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI recently attended a Summer School in Computational Social Science and found it interesting. My previous training and experience involves working with structured data such as household surveys.The summer course introduced me to text analysis among other topics.
One of the common applications of text analysis is social media analysis. After seeing various blogs analysing tweets of US presidential candidates and other prominent individuals, I thought it would be interesting to adapt this to the Zimbabwean presidential candidates following the recent harmonised elections.</description>
