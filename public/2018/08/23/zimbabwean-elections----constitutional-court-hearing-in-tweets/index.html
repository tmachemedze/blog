<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Harmonised elections recently held in Zimbabwe (30/07/2018) were disputed by the leading opposition party, MDC-Alliance. Therefore, they petitioned the Constitional Court to overturn President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s victory as announced by the electoral board, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). The Constitutional court hearing was on 22 Agust 2018 and was trending by the twitter hashtags; <strong>#ConCourtdecides</strong>, <strong>#ConCourtZW</strong>, <strong>#ElectionPetitionZW</strong>, <strong>#ZimConCourt</strong>, <strong>#zimconcourtchallenge</strong>. The court ruling was also set for the 24th of August 2018. I took this opportunity to assess the mood of people (mostly Zimbabweans) as they express themselves on twitter with regard to the proceedings of both the court hearing and ruling. Data was downloaded from the twitter API using the hashtags (mentioned above) as search terms and results are presented below.</p>
<div id="hourly-tweets-21-08-2018-to-26-08-2018" class="section level3">
<h3>Hourly tweets: 21-08-2018 to 26-08-2018</h3>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see peaks for frequency of related tweets on both the court day and court ruling day. From here, we break the analysis into two parts: the court hearing and the court ruling</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="court-hearing-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Court hearing analysis</h2>
<div id="hourly-tweets-on-the-court-hearing" class="section level3">
<h3>Hourly tweets on the court hearing</h3>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Tweets peaked mid-morning of the court date between 9:00am and 11:00am. This is roughly around the time when court was determining whether co-respondents who filed their papers could be heard. The final decision not to consider co-respondents made around that time could have influenced more reactions on twitter.</p>
</div>
<div id="word-cloud-court-hearing-22082018" class="section level3">
<h3>Word cloud: court hearing (22/08/2018)</h3>
<p>The word cloud shows the distribution of frequently used words. We included words that were used at least 10 times. The larger the size of the word, the more frequent it was used.</p>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>“Court”, “evidence” and “Adv” “Thabani” “Mpofu” were among the most mentioned. This is mostly because Adv Thabani Mpofu was representing the applicant and had to prove his case. Twimbos and other followers had varying opinions over his representation - both ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="sentiment-analysis-court-hearing" class="section level3">
<h3>Sentiment analysis: court hearing</h3>
<p>Here, sentiment analysis is applied to identify reactions, attitudes and emotions. In this case, we used the <code>nrc</code> lexicon that categorizes words into emotions of <strong>positive</strong>, <strong>negative</strong>, <strong>anger</strong>, <strong>anticipation</strong>, <strong>disgust</strong>, <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>joy</strong>, <strong>sadness</strong>, <strong>surprise</strong>, and <strong>trust</strong>. We filtered out “positive” and “negative” emotion categories because of negated words that changes the meaning of the context.</p>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The sentiment analysis exclude non-english words and most of these are Shona words (you can see words like “hapana”, “kana”, “nhasi”, “vanhu” in the word cloud). Perhaps someone can create Shona sentiment categories. I am particularly interested in the time period between 06:00 and end of day where we see an increasing number of related tweets. The NRC sentiment analysis shows that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There are flactuations in expression of <strong>anger</strong> that generally falls down over the course of the court hearing.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an initial high <strong>anticipation</strong> that dumpened from mid-morning.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a general increase in <strong>disgust</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>There was increasing <strong>fear</strong> from morning upto around 10am and became less thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Most twimbos started the day with expression of <strong>joy</strong> that was dumpened by mid-morning.</p></li>
<li><p>There is generally increasing <strong>sadness</strong> over the course of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially, there is high <strong>surprise</strong> that slowed down and flattened over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trust</strong> started high and was dumpened by mid-morning and then flactuating thereafter.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="distribution-of-emotion-categories-court-hearing" class="section level3">
<h3>Distribution of emotion categories: court hearing</h3>
<p>The graph below shows the frequency of words falling in each category of emotions.</p>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Sentiments of trust tops in the words used.</p>
</div>
<div id="word-cloud-of-sentimentscourt-hearing" class="section level3">
<h3>Word cloud of sentiments:court hearing</h3>
<p>As opposed to the previous word cloud that uses all words, here we create a word cloud based on the sentiments derived from the tweets. Generally, most of the words in this word cloud match the lexicon definition but there are also other words that appear because of the tweet they come from than their sentiment. For example, if a “trust” word appears frequently in tweets expressing “joy”, that word might appear in this word cloud as “joy” because of association and its frequency and not its sentiment.</p>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see some of the words and their associated emotion categories.</p>

<div id="court-ruling-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Court ruling analysis</h2>
<div id="hourly-tweets-on-the-court-ruling" class="section level3">
<h3>Hourly tweets on the court ruling</h3>
<p><img src="https://tmachemedze.netlify.com/post/2018-08-23-concourt_challenge_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Court ruling was initially set for 14:00 on the 24th of August. The time was changed to 15:00 and the announcement was made in the court room at around 14:00. This explains the peak at the 2 o’clock hour of people expressing their anxiety and disappointment of this change in time.</p>
</div>
<div id="word-cloud-court-ruling-24082018" class="section level3">
<h3>Word cloud: court ruling (24/08/2018)</h3>

<p>It is not surprising that tweets on the court ruling were dominated by “Malaba”, the Chief Justice, as he was presenting the ruling over the case.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is increasing expression of <strong>anger</strong>, <strong>anticipation</strong>, <strong>disgust</strong>, <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>joy</strong>, <strong>sadness</strong> and <strong>surprise</strong> after the court ruling.</p></li>

</ol>
<div id="tweets-expressing-sentiments-of-joy" class="section level4">
<h4>Tweets expressing sentiments of joy</h4>
<p>It is curious to note that when other negative emotions are going up, <strong>joy</strong> is also going up. Below we extract some of the tweets associated with sentiments of joy to see what is happening. We take a sample of six related tweets that were twitted after 17:00.</p>

I used to respect CJ Malaba, his reputation preceded him but now he has joined the likes of former CJ Chidyausiku &amp;amp; Judge Chiweshe.

</table>
<p>Generally, the above tweets have mixed emotions. Joy related emotion/sentiment are derived from words like “victory”, “clown”, “God”, “respect”, “celebrating” and “dawn”. This example illustrates that computers are far from taking over some human jobs, we still need human judgement. This is because lexicon based sentiment analysis fails to understand context, sarcasm, multiple languages and other variations in sentence construction. However, there are some tweets suggesting that the ruling was celebrated by others.</p>

<p>Again, words of trust are the most frequent.</p>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Clearly, the court hearing was followed by a significant number of twimbos. There are various patterns of sentiments expressed over the course of the court hearing. Twimbos who expresed themselves on twitter were generally not happy with the court ruling as shown by rising negative emotions. There is also a segment of twimbos who appear to express joy on the ruling. We also acknowledge that the sentiment detection methods are not 100% reliable based on what we observed with the “joy” sentiment. Through following some twitter handles, I observed that there are threads where the court proceedings were discussed but without using the above mentioned hashtags. Therefore, some related tweets were missed and these could have an effect on the results.</p>
