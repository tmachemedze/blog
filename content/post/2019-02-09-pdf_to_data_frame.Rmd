## Introduction

I recently found myself needing to extract some tables from PDF format to some tabular format that I can manipulate in `R`. I needed to extract municipal population and GDP estimates from a [document](http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/D9129/D91292012.pdf) published by Statistics South Africa. Fortunately, the `tabulizer` package in R makes this task easier. The `tabulizer` package also depends on the `rJava` and `tabulizerjars` packages. I will start by loading these together with the `tidyverse` packages for data manipulation.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(rJava) # load and attach 'rJava' now
library(tabulizer)
library(tabulizerjars)
library(tidyverse)
```

In my learning process, I started with a simple table like Table 7.1 from the [document](http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/D9129/D91292012.pdf). 

```{r tab1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Preview of Table 7.1", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("table1.png")
```

I will start by specifying the PDF file location or path.  

```{r}
# Location of pdf file
file <- "http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/D9129/D91292012.pdf"
```

The main function from the `tabulizer` package is `extract_tables`. It has several options to specify but in my case I need to specify the page number for Table 7.1 in addition to the `file`.

```{r}
# Extract the table
zipf_df <- extract_tables(file, pages = 21)

#to data frame
zipf_df<-as.data.frame(zipf_df[[1]])

#Check
head(zipf_df)
```
The column names are in the first row and we need to correct this.

```{r}
#first row to colnames
colnames(zipf_df) <- as.character(unlist(zipf_df[1,]))

#drop first row
zipf_df = zipf_df[-1, ] 
#check
head(tbl_df(zipf_df),15)
```

The main task is done and I can then format table headers, etc.


Now I have an idea of how the package works and I want to extract tables from Appendices 1, 2 and 5. 

```{r tab2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Preview of Appendix 1", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("table2.png")
```

These tables are slightly different to the one extracted above as they overlap many pages and wrapped header text is read as separate lines. If I repeat the above R code:

```{r}
# Extract the table
app1_df <- extract_tables(file, pages = 32)

#to data frame
app1_df<-as.data.frame(app1_df[[1]])
head(app1_df)
```

The wrapped text is included in rows 1 to 4 and columns names not correct. We can correct this as follows:

```{r}
names(app1_df)<-c("MN_NAME","pop2013","pop2013adj","emp2013","emp2013adj","unemp2013","unemp2013adj", "GDPM2011","blank","GDPM2011adj")
app1_df<-app1_df[-c(1:4),] 

app1_df
```

At least it is not difficult to tidy this table, i.e., remove first four rows and assigning header names. To extract the full table, I will have to loop the above code and append pages 32 top 40 as follows:

```{r}
muni_df<-data.frame() #empty data. frame

for(i in 32:40) {
  temp_df <- extract_tables(file, pages = i)
  temp_df<-as.data.frame(temp_df[[1]]) 
  
  names(temp_df)<-c("MN_NAME","pop2013","pop2013adj","emp2013","emp2013adj","unemp2013","unemp2013adj", "GDPM2011","blank","GDPM2011adj")
  temp_df<-temp_df[-c(1:4),]
  
  muni_df<-rbind(muni_df,temp_df)
}

#remove commas in numbers and make them numeric
muni_df[2:10]=sapply(muni_df[2:10],function(x) gsub(",","",x))

muni_df<-muni_df %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.numeric) %>% #character numbers to numeric
  mutate_if(is.factor,as.character) %>% #factor municipality names to character
  select(-blank)  #drop empty column

str(muni_df)
```

And boom, we have data for all 234 municipalites. I can do the same for appendices 2 (pages 41:49) and 5 (pages 69:77). Finally I save the extracted table to csv for future use. 

```{r}
write.table(muni_df, file = "./mn_pop_gdp.csv", sep = ",", row.names = FALSE, qmethod = "double")
```

*Note*: The above was enough to solve my problem but the `tabulizer` has many other options and specifications. For example,  I left the package to `guess` the table location but you can as well use `locate_areas` to your liking.
